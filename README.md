# Cryptocurrency Chatbot with LLaMA Model Integration

This project is an AI-powered chatbot that leverages the **LLaMA 3.1 8B model from Together AI** to engage in conversations and answer queries about cryptocurrency prices. The chatbot is designed to handle multi-turn conversations, recognize cryptocurrency-related questions, and provide accurate real-time data from the CoinGecko API. It maintains context across interactions, allowing for seamless and coherent conversations.

## Features

- **Multi-Turn Conversation**: Maintains conversation history to provide context-aware responses across multiple interactions.
- **Cryptocurrency Price Fetching**: Detects and responds to cryptocurrency-related queries using the CoinGecko API.
- **Language Translation**: Translates user input to English, ensuring consistent system responses in English.
- **Reset Command**: Users can reset the conversation context with a simple command (`reset`).
- **Caching and Rate Limiting**: Implements caching and rate limiting for API calls to optimize performance and reduce dependency on external services.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone [https://https://github.com/1sarthakbhardwaj/Sarvam-AI](https://github.com/1sarthakbhardwaj/Sarvam-AI.git)
cd Sarvam-AI
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Register on [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) to obtain an API key. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the API key:

```plaintext
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Run the chatbot:

```bash
python main.py
```

Type 'exit' to quit the application and 'reset' to clear the conversation history and start fresh.

```

## Prompt Engineering Approach

- **Context Management**: The chatbot uses a `ContextManager` to keep track of the conversation history, enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.
- **Translation Consistency**: User messages are translated to English to ensure that all system responses remain in English, regardless of input language.
- **Cryptocurrency Detection**: Regex-based pattern detection is used to recognize and respond to cryptocurrency-related queries without sending unnecessary requests to the model.

## Example Conversations

**Example 1: General Question**

```plaintext
You: What is the capital of France?
LLaMA Model: The capital of France is Paris.
```

**Example 2: Cryptocurrency Price Query**

```plaintext
You: What is the price of Bitcoin?
LLaMA Model: The current price of Bitcoin in USD is 45000.
```

**Example 3: Multi-Turn Conversation**

```plaintext
You: What is the capital of France?
LLaMA Model: The capital of France is Paris.
You: What is the population?
LLaMA Model: The population of Paris is approximately 2.1 million.
```

**Example 4: Reset Command**

```plaintext
You: reset
LLaMA Model: Conversation context has been reset. How can I help you?
```

## Assumptions and Limitations

**Assumptions**

- Users have registered with Together AI and have a valid API key.
- The CoinGecko API is available and does not limit frequent requests.

**Limitations**

- **API Rate Limits**: The application uses caching and rate limiting to manage API requests, but extensive use could still hit limits.
- **Language Translation Accuracy**: While Google Translate is used for language translation, nuances in language might not always be perfectly captured.
- **Context Reset**: The context is reset if the application is restarted, meaning previous conversation history won’t persist between sessions.

## Logs and Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: All conversation history and errors are logged in `logs/conversation.log`.
- **Error Handling**: If errors occur (e.g., issues with API calls), the bot logs these errors and provides helpful feedback to the user.
